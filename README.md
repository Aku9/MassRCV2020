# Massachusetts Ranked Choice Voting 2020
An exploratory analysis of voting and demographics in Massachusetts.

In this project, I examine the votes on the Massachusetts 2020 general election ballot.
These were the presidential election, the senate election and two ballot measures: the Right to Repair initiative and Ranked Choice Voting.
I compare the Ranked Choice Voting results to the other three votes as well as as a number of demographic predictors (Age, Eduation, Income, Race, and Population)

I found that all four votes were highly correlated with each other. Far moreso than they were with the demographic factors.

The analysis (MassachusettsRankedChoiceVoting2020.ipynb) and all of the required files can be found in the MassachusettsRankedChoiceVoting2020 folder.
The raw data from the Massachusetts secretary of state and the US census websites are in the .csv files and the shapefiles needed to plot the maps are in the townssurvey_shp folder.
